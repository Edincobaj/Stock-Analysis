# Stock-Analysis
## Project Overview
### The objective of this analysis is to refactor our stock analysis code to be able to handle more than a few stocks quickly.

## Results
### From our analysis we can see that all companies besides TERP had a positive return in 2017, this was not the case in 2018. In 2018 only 2 companies had a positive return, ENPH and RUN, while all other companies had negative returns. If we were to advise on which company to invest in it would be ENPH. This is because they had a higher overall return over the two year period.
### This can be shown in the pictures below:

### We also see a noticable increase in execution times when comparing the original script with the refactored script.
